[Check Out the Calculator](https://github.com/zhadaray/va-disability-calculator) or [Read About It](https://www.zhadaray.com/post/va-disability-guide)


Description: Developed a VA Disability Rating Calculator using Python and Flask to automate the complex process of calculating disability ratings for veterans. The tool implements the VA's rating algorithm and allows users to input multiple conditions, displaying the final combined disability rating based on official guidelines.

Skills & Concepts:

- Data Transformation & Analysis: Designed and coded a custom algorithm to combine multiple disability percentages according to the VA's formula.
- Logical Programming: Built algorithms using logical structures (ex: if-else statements, loops, functions) to automate calculations and data processing.
- Data Modeling: Used dictionaries to represent relationships and rules in the data.

Outcome: Successfully built a fully functional web app that simplifies the disability rating process, providing veterans with a fast and accurate way to estimate their combined disability rating.
